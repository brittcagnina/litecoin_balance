Litecoin Balance
================

App is currently here:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinhark.litecoinbalance&hl=en

Android app that allows users to easily keep up with various Litecoin addresses.

Though this application is not a wallet, it provides functionality other apps currently do not.

If the reception is positive, I will continue to make improvements.

Desired Features:
- Style/UI Improvements
- Improve Error Handling
- Add address market value in USD
- Performance Improvements (Balance load time, Faster address creation)
- Add feature to edit individual addresses
- Add Tablet Support
